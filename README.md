<div align='center'><h1> Game: Check yourself if probability exists </h1>
<h2> (Is probability that probable?)(IPTP) </h2></div>

--------------------------------------------------

<ul>
<strong><li> Required: </li></strong><br>
    1. 2 or more players <br>
    2. Deck of 52 cards <br>
    3. Score board of probability <br>

---------------------------------------------------

<strong><li> How to Play: </li></strong><br>
    <ol>
        <li> One player (when his/her turn comes) picks any number of
        cards from the deck. This player is referred to as the 
        'speaker'. </li>
        <li> Without showing cards to anybody else, he/she says two
        vague statements (probabilities of which can be easily
        found out), one of the two statements is true which only
        the speaker knows. </li>
        <li> Now the probability of the two statements is to be found <br>
        out by the other players. </li>
        <li> The statement with higher probability is then announced to
        the speaker by the other players. </li>
        <li> If the statement with higher probability is correct then point on score board must be given to probability and vice versa. </li>
        <li> This process must be repeated maximum possible number of times to check if probability actually exists.</li></ol>
