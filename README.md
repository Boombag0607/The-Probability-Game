Game: Check yourself if probability
exists <br>
(Is probability that probable?)(IPTP) <br>
• Required: <br>
    1. 2 or more players <br>
    2. Deck of 52 cards <br>
    3. Score board of probability <br>
• How to Play: <br>
    1. One player (when his/her turn comes) picks any number of <br>
        cards from the deck. This player is referred to as the <br>
        'speaker'. <br>
    2. Without showing cards to anybody else, he/she says two <br>
        vague statements (probabilities of which can be easily <br>
        found out), one of the two statements is true which only <br>
        the speaker knows. <br>
    3. Now the probability of the two statements is to be found <br>
        out by the other players. <br>
    4. The statement with higher probability is then announced to <br>
        the speaker by the other players. <br>
    5. If the statement with higher probability is correct then <br>        point on score board must be given to probability and vice <br>
    <br>    versa.
<br> 6. This process must be repeated maximum possible number of times <br>to check if probability actually exists.
