Game: Check yourself if probability
exists
(Is probability that probable?)(IPTP)
• Required:
    1. 2 or more players
    2. Deck of 52 cards
    3. Score board of probability (notebook, duh!)
• How to Play:
    1. One player (when his/her turn comes) picks any number of
        cards from the deck. This player is referred to as the
        'speaker'.
    2. Without showing cards to anybody else, he/she says two
        vague statements (probabilities of which can be easily
        found out), one of the two statements is true which only
        the speaker knows.
    3. Now the probability of the two statements is to be found
        out by the other players.
    4. The statement with higher probability is then announced to
        the speaker by the other players.
    5. If the statement with higher probability is correct then
        point on score board must be given to probability and vice
        versa.
    6. This process must be repeated maximum possible number of times to    check if probability actually exists.
